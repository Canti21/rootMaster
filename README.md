## Description

RootMaster is a web application that helps you find the roots of mathematical functions using various numerical methods. Whether you need to solve equations using the bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, or Muller's method, this calculator has you covered.

## Server Performance Notice

Please note that the calculator is hosted on a server that may experience slower performance if it hasn't been accessed in the last 5 minutes. This delay occurs because the server needs time to "wake up" and respond to incoming requests after a period of inactivity.

If you encounter slow loading times, we recommend waiting for a moment as the server becomes responsive again. Subsequent requests should be faster.

## Usage

1. Access the calculator on the web at [rootmaster.onrender.com](https://rootmaster.onrender.com/).
2. Choose a numerical method from the available options in the menu (e.g., Bisection, Newton-Raphson).
3. Enter a mathematical function in the input field.
4. Set the initial parameters and precision (if applicable).
5. Click the "Calculate" button to find the roots of the function.
6. View the results on the page, including the root and any iterations performed.
